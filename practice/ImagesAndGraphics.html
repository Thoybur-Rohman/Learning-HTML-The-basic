Question 1 of 13
If you want to create a compact image that can display in large sizes without pixelation, which should you choose?
SVG
Scalable Vector Graphics can scale to massive sizes and still look neat, like they were built for it.

Question 2 of 13
Which code snippet makes correct use of <figure> and <figcaption>?

<figure>
<img src="https://figuresource.com/40289/alfonso.jpg" 
  width="720" height="354" alt="The Gracious Host" >
<figcaption> Alfonso serving pancakes </figcaption>
</figure>

Question 3 of 13
Which version of the image in the following code would be the slowest to load?
 

<img src="https://storage.net/40785/sunsetA.jpg" 
alt="Beach at sunset" width = "512" height="128"
srcset="https://storage.net/40785/sunsetB.jpg 1.5x,
https://storage.net/40785/sunsetC.jpg 3x,
https://storage.net/40785/sunsetD.jpg 2x"
>

sunsetC.jpg
Correct

The largest image loads the slowest.

Question 4 of 13
If you want to keep a caption with an image, which combination of elements lets you identify them as connected?

Surround the image with a figure element, and use the figcaption element inside of figure.
Correct

<figure> is designed to contain a caption that will stay with your image.

Question 6 of 13
What do you need to change to move from a resolution-based srcset to a width-based srcset?

Provide pixel measurements (w) instead of 1x, 2x, etc.
Correct
Yes - setting the width explicitly changes srcset's behavior.

Question 7 of 13
What are the four attributes we want to include on every img element?

src, alt, height, width
Yes. src is short for source, and links to the file. Alt provides an alternative text experience of the image.
 Height and width let the browser know how much space the image needs before the file is fetched, improving performance.

Question 8 of 13
Why should you spend effort optimizing image sources and corresponding display attributes?
to have the best compromise between image quality and download speed
Correct

Bear in mind that there is no value in downloading data that will not be used.

Question 9 of 13
Why should you include the height and width specifications for all images?

to make the page layout more efficient
Correct

The size of an image can be learned before download is complete.

Question 10 of 13
How do you create an image that changes content depending on the surrounding layout?

Nest img, source, and srcset information inside of a picture element.
Correct

The <picture> element gives you the flexibility you need to change content as well as image size.

Question 11 of 13
Which format is best suited to handle complex drawings and logos?
SVG is a vector graphics format for describing complex drawings.

Question 12 of 13
Why is it advantageous to utilize the picture element when using these images as sources?
The images are cropped differently.
Correct
It is convenient to use the picture element when aspect ratios and cropping change from one source to another.

Question 13 of 13
Why would you want to use the w specification in srcset instead of the x specification?
to consider both display density and window width when choosing the image source
Correct
You can specify the width of the source image in the code.
